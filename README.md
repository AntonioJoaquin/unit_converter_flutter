## Minimalism

To make the app as minimalist as possible, it consists of just two screens.

The *main screen* where we will directly select the *category* in which we want to convert; and the *conversion screen*. In the latter we write in the field that we want to convert and all the others will be filled with their corresponding value automatically. In this way, we save ourselves selecting units and clicking on a button to execute the action.

If we want to change the *category* we do not have to return to the main screen, it has some tabs to be able to change directly on that same screen.
